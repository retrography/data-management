## Course Objectives

This course is designed to provide a first hands-on experience with databases as well as a general understanding of data management concepts for B.Com. student completing the concentration/major in Information Systems or interested in data and data management.

This course is open to students in their 3rd year. It will count towards the IS concentration or major. This is not a substitute for database design and development courses offered in computer science departments.

This course does not assume any specific technical background or programming skill, but it comprises a strong technical component and requires a willingness to invest in technical skills. You are advised to take [INSY 442 Business Intelligence and Data Analytics](http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2015-2016/courses/insy-442) either before or along with this course in order to benefit fully from the content of the course.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of data storage, retrieval and transformation
- Use a web scraping tool (Kimono) and data APIs
- Understand the concept of data quality and use a data cleaning and transformation tool (OpenRefine)
- Connect to and use a relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Apply modeling techniques to design a simple database
- Run simple and complex SQL queries
- Use a visualization tool backed by a database (Tableau)
- Work in teams and run a data analysis project from data import to reporting
- Grasp the increasing importance of data privacy and information security for citizens and corporations
- Analyze the data life cycle in organizations
- Examine how data enables new business models
- Understand the new trends in big data, data science, data-enabled decision making
- Understand the new trends in open data and release of public data
- Conceptualize the increasing importance of data privacy and information security for citizens and corporations

## ￼￼Grading and Evaluation

| __Activity__                 | __Grade__ |
|------------------------------|:---------:|
| Final project (team)         |    45%    |
| Theoretical Quiz             |    25%    |
| Practical Quiz               |    20%    |
| Attendance and Participation |    10%    |

## Project

The project is a group exercise that will take you through all the stages of data gathering, import, cleaning and to some extent analysis. Project assessment will be gradual and based on several deliverables due throughout the term, with the bulk of project grade being defined by your final results, final presentation and final report.

You will be asked to:

- Structure an open-ended problem and propose a well-studied roadmap for your project
- Identify at least one additional data source that you can augment the project's original datasets with
- Demonstrate that you have successfully cleaned your data and imported it in a database
- Carry out your data transformation and analysis plan, according to your roadmap, and present the results
- Explain in a final report the stages you went through and the way you arrived at your results (How one can reproduce your results?)

Make sure you allocate enough time to your project at the beginning of the term to build up your team and identify the responsibilities. Some aspects of the project (like finding datasets and cleaning the data) will simply need time to get done, and will not be much accelerated even if you dedicate all your time at the end of the trimester.

For more information about the project, see the [project page](./project).

## Quizzes

- Theory Quiz (25% of final grade): The quiz will cover the compulsory readings from theoretical sessions, material discussed during the class and eventual presentations by classmates or guest speakers.

- Technical Quiz (20% of final grade): The quiz will cover technical concepts and skills, including SQL.

If you attend and actively participate in class discussion, these should be quite straightforward. The quizzes will take about 45 minutes of the class period and will be composed of a few short essay and query building questions.

## Attendance/Participation

Please e-mail us before class if you will be missing a session. If you miss more than two sessions, your participation grade will drop. However, being in class is not sufficient for receiving full participation points. Be active and contribute to class discussions!
