## Description

This is a semester-long team-based project. You will work in a team of four or five to solve a semi-structured analytic issue, from data gathering to reporting.

You will be given a project description containing a number of open-ended questions that require a data-driven, analytic approach to answer. The project description will also point you to two data sources that you will have to complement with a third dataset you find useful in your research proposal. Then you will go through all the stages of a simple analytics project, guided by your initial proposal.

The main requirement of the project is to create value added by joining different pieces of data in your analysis. The purpose of this lengthy practice is to learn how to make a ready-for-analysis version of your data in the database, and then learn how to query it.

Many academic courses take data availability and data quality for granted and prepare you for data analysis. This course emphasizes the pre-analysis stage of analytics. It requires you to approach the data with the objective of tackling an issue, and gives you a variety of tools to do so. Technically speaking, you will have to:

1. Gather or access your data
2. Clean and reshape the data (to the extent required by your analysis)
3. Import the data in a relational database
4. Transform the data again if needed
5. Query the database through different analytics suites and produce convincing outcomes

It might be tempting to do a truncated version of all the above steps in a single software suite, but that is not the objective of this course, and will certainly not prepare you for today's job market.

Pro Tips: You may have to iterate over 2, 3 and 4 a couple of times. You may also have to aggregate the data if there is too much detail (excessive granularity).

## Roles

You will be asked to take on a specific role within your team. You will be assessed based on your success in your responsibilities as well as your team's overall success in the project.

**Leader:** Manages the team and synchronizes member activities. The leader is proactive and makes sure the team is making due progress. The leader also resolves conflicts between members and makes sure the work of individual members is consolidated into a whole. The leader will have an even working charge throughout the trimester.

**Data Engineer:** The data engineer is responsible for the data infrastructure of the project. Every team member is supposed to contribute to the data stage, but the data engineer is the person who takes the responsibility of this stage and has the final say on the details of the data stage. She (or He) Is the person who makes sure the data is harvested, cleaned, imported and prepared within due time for analysis and visualization. The data engineer role is a head-heavy role, as the bulk of the data stage happens at the beginning of the project.

**Data Analyst:** Takes the responsibility of the data analysis stage of the project. The analyst is not the only person who does the analysis, but is the person who is held responsible for the analytics and will have the final say on it. The analyst role is a tail-heavy role: The real analysis starts only when the data is ready.

**Visualization Expert:** Works closely with the analyst and takes the responsibility of the visual representation of the outcomes. The visualization expert is not the only person who contributes visualizations, but is the person who is held responsible for the quality of the visual outcomes and will have the final say on them. The visualization expert role is a tail-heavy role: The real visualization starts only when the data is ready.

**Reporter:** Works closely with the leader to make sure the team's reports and presentations are presented as a coherent whole and in a timely manner. The reporter is not supposed to do the whole writeup for the team, but is the one who orchestrates the reporting, does the quality assurance, and consolidates the reports. The reporter's role is also tail-heavy: Most of the deliverables of the project are due at the end of the semester.

## Deliverables and Grading Scheme

### February 1 - Project Proposal (~10% of the final grade)

The leader and the reporter of each team submit a short proposal (~500-700 words) detailing a structured view of the problem the team wants to tackle, and a tentative roadmap for the project. The document also has to identify at least one additional data source to augment the default project datasets.

Some of the questions the proposal must answer:

  - How does the data you are gathering link to the research questions you are putting forward?
  - What data will you gather and how (in concrete terms)? How much data is that? Have you done your feasibility study?
  - What is the added value of joining these different pieces of data?
  - What is your project timeline?
  - How are the tasks distributed to the members?

This document is binding, so make sure you have thought everything through.

Pro Tips:

  - Define modest, well-studied and doable objectives. Expand if you have additional time at the end of the term. Most teams need to do two iterations to get to acceptable results, so take that in account.
  - Joining datasets involves finding valuable links between them. For instance if you can join the census data with the election data based on geographical parameters, you may find an interesting relation between median total income per capita in neighborhoods and voting patterns in those neighborhoods. But establishing this kind of link is not always as easy as it seems. For instance, Statistics Canada and Elections Canada may not use the exact same geographical partitioning, or may not offer their data at the same level of granularity. That complicates the task of establishing links!

### February 17 - Progress Report (~10% of the final grade)

The progress report is composed of two documents and a presentation:

  - The data engineer of each team submits a document (~1500-2000 words) describing the team's data cleaning and import process, as well as outlining the final data structure. The document may also include the team's data transformation plans, if any.

  - The data analyst and visualization specialist of each team submit a short document (~500-700 word) that will give an overview of how the team sees the different pieces of data coming together and how the data will be used for the upcoming analytic steps.

  - The leader of each team will present the team's database to the class. No powerpoint slide is required. The presentation will take only five minutes and the data must be demonstrated on a live database connection.

### April 6 and 11 - Final Presentation & Final Report (~25% of the final grade)

The final presentation will mainly focus on the outcomes of the analysis, and if necessary will take the form of a debate with the other teams working on the same project. Live queries and interactive visuals are preferred to static reports and charts. Use powerpoint only for the opening, and then go back to the analysis software you have used. All the team members are asked to take part in the final presentation.

The final report will be submitted by the reporter of each team. It has to focus on the main findings, as well as the description of all the stages the team went through to produce the results. It will also include the content of all the previous deliverables, and will have to address the discrepancies between the plans and the final process/results. The final report is supposed to provide enough information to allow your peers reproduce the gist of your work. You are encouraged to submit your files and/or links with it. There are no page limits for the final report, but in analytics clarity and conciseness always win over length.
